# WMC-Battery

Python re-implementation of the WMC battery described in Lewandowsky, S., Oberauer, K., Yang, L. X., & Ecker, U. K. (2010). A working memory test battery for MATLAB. Behavior research methods, 42(2), 571â€“585. https://doi.org/10.3758/BRM.42.2.571

This implementation is a minute reproduction of the original MATLAB implementation and uses the same file output format.
This way the accompanying R-script of the original implementation can still be used for data processing.


## Differences to original MATLAB implementation

- implementation limited to the following tasks: Memory Update, Operation Span, Sentence Span, and Spatial Short-Term Memory  (left out Choice Reaction Test, Task Switching, and Word Recognition as not references in paper)
- random seed can be either set explicitly or will be automatically determined by the session name / subject id
- Spatial Short-Term Memory trials are dynamically generated for each new experiment run
- corrections in chinese language files (instruction pages, experiment messages and sentences for Sentence Span task)


## Installation

### Ubuntu 20.04
You may need to put `.local/bin` in your `PATH` by adding this to your `.bashrc` in your home folder:
```
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

After that, create a new terminal and close the old one to reload the configuration.

```
sudo apt-get install psychopy python3-pip python3-wxgtk-webview4.0 libxcb-xinerama0

pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -U -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-20.04 wxPython==4.1.1
```

For Chinese font support:

```
sudo apt-get install fonts-noto-cjk
```


### Mac OS

```
pip install psychopy==2020.2.10 pygame wxPython numpy pandas scipy dotmap pyyaml
```

For Chinese, please download and install the required font package 'Noto Serif CJK SC': https://www.google.com/get/noto/

The support for font install : https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/install/



### Windows

```
pip install psychopy==2020.2.10 pygame wxPython numpy pandas scipy dotmap pyyaml
```

For Chinese, please download and install the required font package 'Noto Serif CJK SC': https://www.google.com/get/noto/

## Run WMC Battery

### Ubuntu 20.04


```
python3 wmc_ubuntu.py
```


### MacOS


```
python3 wmc_mac.py
```


### Windows


```
python3 wmc_windows.py
```


## Usage

You can quit the experiment by pressing `F12`.


It is advised to mark the arrow-keys on your physical keyboard for the *Operation Span* and *Sentence Span* tasks. You can configure the keys in the `yaml`-config files in the `config` folder (`key_map` field).


## Test language files

You can test your language files by running the following command:

```
python3 test_language.py
```

You will move through all experiment messages, instruction pages, a summary for sentence span sentences and all sentence span sentences with the respective label. For the sentence summary, moving on is possible only after one second has passed to prevent accidental skipping.
