While the thief hid the jewellery ran down the street
While Sarah ironed the shirt went out for dinner
While Anna dressed the baby chased its tail
While Betty woke up the neighbour spilled on the floor
As Darren washed the clothes chased a ball
As Jan bathed the cat was secure in the safe
As Becca cleaned the dog stretched out of shape
As Karen woke her son rose in the oven
As Mia dressed the salad crawled in the playpen
While the man hid the key stamped its hoof
As Dan drank the milk rolled over the hill
While Helen shook the bottle read a poem
As the koala ate the leaves climbed down the tree
While the girl hid the necklace it stood in the yard
As Wally washed the jumper it played in the backyard
As Henry whittled the stick it boiled over
As Janet baked the bread it swung on her neck
While Tom grilled the hotdog it lay on the desk
While Rick drove the car it sat on the sofa
As the confectioner garnished the cake it surfed a wave
While the lawyer studied the contract it broke in half
As the mare fed it the colt fell on the floor
As the chef stirred the soup it veered into the ditch
While Ron made the sandwich it laughed out loud
As Chris played the bass it breathed underwater
While Sam waved the flag it answered the phone
While Kate typed the memo she arrived in the mail
As Mark vacuumed the drapes he spun in the dryer
As Jerry played the violin he gathered dust in the attic
While Harry scratched the record he spun in the player
While Kendra parked the van she rusted in the yard
As the man walked the poodle he slept calmly
While Frank read the notes he burned in the fireplace
While the journalist photographed the rocket he exploded
As Ben opened the beer he foamed over
As Lucy grabbed her mobile she started ringing
While Gino prepared the ice-cream he melted in the sun
As Tony entered the bus he was full of people
While the mother calmed down the kids hung on the line
As the woman jumped she was in a coma
