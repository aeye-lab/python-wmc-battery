While Josh read the book jumped off the plane
As the patient scratched the scar made a funny face
As Simon heated the water he evaporated slowly
As Charles admired the rose flew to the moon
While the snake swallowed the frog it played chess
As the tourist watched the dolphin danced a waltz
While Serge looked at the painting he fell from the wall
While the puppy sniffed the kitten it began to burn
