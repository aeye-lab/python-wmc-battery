While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods
While the skipper sailed the boat veered off course
As the maid dusted the picture fell to the floor
As Charlize ate the turkey pecked at the corn
As the boy washed the plate crashed to the floor
While Jack ordered the fish cooked in the pot
While the director filmed the actor recited the lines
While Sam counted the children boarded the bus
As Edward drove the truck shuddered to a halt
While the vet shaved the dog ran around the yard
As Toby sang a song played on the radio
As Fiona dialled the number was called out
While James moved his foot got caught in a gap
As Mary dried off the dish it fell into the sink
As the girl scratched the puppy it slept soundly
As the chemist washed the test-tube it shattered
While the girl dressed the doll it sat on the shelf
While the cat bathed the kitten it miaowed softly
As Pete washed the floor it became slippery
As Roger woke up the parrot it squawked loudly
While Verna dried off the dog it shook suddenly
While Susan wrote the letter it fell off the table
As Bertie cleaned the car it shone in the sun
As Luke climbed the wall got painted over
While the farmer rode the horse it started running
As Tim dropped the vase it broke into pieces
While Lisa drank the water she drove down the street
As the athlete wrestled the opponent he shouted insults
As Tina undressed the figurine she tipped it over
As Carrie bathed the toddler she screamed loudly
As the child hid the toy it smiled in anticipation
While the nurse shaved the patient she watched TV
As Paula woke her husband she grumbled loudly
While Jim bathed the child he giggled with delight
While Brie packed the bag she fell off the chair
As Herb breathed the gas he began to faint
As Jane called her friend she was terribly scared
While Sean kissed his wife he remembered a movie
While Eddie ran the track was closed for maintenance
As the stranger watched the girl it ran away
