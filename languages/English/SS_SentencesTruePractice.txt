While the jockey settled down the horse ate some hay
While the director filmed the actor recited the lines
As the zookeeper fed the tiger he walked in the enclosure
As Abby withdrew her hand began to shiver
As Bill paddled the canoe it headed toward a waterfall
While Anna combed her son she sat on the grass
As the lion attacked the baboon watched from its cage 
While the doctor dressed the wound it bled slowly
